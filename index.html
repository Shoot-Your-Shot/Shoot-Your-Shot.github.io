<h1>Shoot Your Shot</h1>
<p>

  <p>
    Shoot Your Shot is a mobile puzzle game created in Unity, designed for users interested in the viral internet phenomenon surrounding trick shots. The game includes a tutorial to teach first-time users, followed by a set of 10 diverse, challenging levels that allow players to make trick shots in unique environments without requiring any setup. Each level is designed such that users can either opt for the easier route and shoot straight for the target, or bounce the ball off of objects throughout the environment before landing in the target. Three stars are located across each level to give hints at where the ball needs to be thrown in order to bounce off objects and hit the target; stars serve as a metric to show a playerâ€™s mastery of a level, and as a currency to allow players to progress to later levels.
