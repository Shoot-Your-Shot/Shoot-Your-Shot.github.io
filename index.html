<h1>Shoot Your Shot</h1>
<p>
  By Shaina Stein, Josh Grafil, Lucas Schiller, Adnan Shilleh<br>
  A brief description of the project (can be very similar to final report section 2!)<br>
  A picture of each team member<br>
  For every team member: a short (one paragraph) biosketch that says a little about you, your interests, dreams etc.  If you know where you are heading next, please include that too!<br>
